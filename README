	Testing this code came in two parts. First was the main 
method which was designed mostly to retest the different sort
methods from the previous two weeks' assignments. This was
done by building eight different lists all containing the same
data in the form of contacts. The unsorted lists were printed
to show that they were not originally sorted. Then they were
were sorted using one of each of the sort methods from 
MyArrayList and MyLinked list, so that each of the six methods
were tested.

	The second and more thorough part of the testing came in the
form of JUnit tests created by our TA Paul Soulier. The JUnit
test that he provided was MyLinkedListIteratorTest. The JUnit
test MyArrayListIteratorTest is the same as
MyLinkedListIteratorTest, but I used "Ctrl-f" to replace every
"MyLinkedList" with "MyArrayList" so that the iterator method
in the MyArrayList class was tested as well.
